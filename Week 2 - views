iOS - Week 2

Creating Views 
- three methods to create views:
1 programmatic
2 Interface Builder
3 storyboard 
- new visual way to represent screens, flows 
- not widely used yet in production apps

UIView
- responsible for drawing a region of the screen
- hierarchy: UIImageView > UIView > UIWindow
- common properties: background color, alpha, frame, hidden, border, border radius
- properties that can be animated: frame / bounds / center, transform, alpha, background color
- may have arbitrary number of subviews
- views do not clip their subviews by default (need to specify that explicitly)
- detects touch events, gestures
- common display views: UILabel, UIImageView, UIButton, UIWebView
- common alert views: UIAlertView, UIActionSheet
- common container views: UIScrollView, UITableView, UICollectionView, UIToolbar
- common input views: UITextField, UITextView, UISearchBar
- common control views: UISwitch, UISlider, UIPickerView, UISegmentedControl, UIPageControl

UIView vs. CALayer
- UIView is a wrapper around CALayer
- rarely work with CALayer, except for:
1 changing border, border radius properties
2 using Core Animation (though View Animations will generally be enough)

Events
- events bubble up a chain of objects, starting with innermost view, then moving up the hierarchy
- first responder: first object in the responder chain
- if the first responder takes text input, keyboard will display
- userInteractionEnabled = NO means object will be skipped in responder chain
- will rarely touch the responder chain except to debug issues with touch detection, setting userInteractionEnabled = NO

AutoresizingMask / Autolayout
- pre-Autolayout, views were positioned absolutely (struts & springs model)
- common situations for AutoresizingMask:
1 unknown height
2 shrinking cells when table edit controls become visible
3 device orientation changes
4 shared views between iPhone, iPad

Navigation
- navigation stack: most common navigation mechanism
- general tasks:
1 pushing new view controller
2 popping view controller
3 programmatically rearranging view controller stack (rare)
- tab bar
- general tasks:
1 initializing available tabs
2 hiding / showing tab bar
